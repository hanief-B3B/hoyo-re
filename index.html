    <h1>Incident Report: Lost Hoyoverse Account</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Incident Details</h2>
        <p>I lost my phone during my commute, and since I did not use a phone password (it was mainly for light gaming), I was unable to secure my device. The two-factor authentication (2FA) for my account is linked to a phone number attached to that lost phone. Additionally, the SIM card was in the lost phone, which may have contributed to unauthorized access to my account. Although I eventually recovered my Gmail accounts, it appears that my Hoyoverse accountâ€™s recovery email and password were changed without my consent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Account Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Username:</strong> Hanifu</p>
        <p>This is the username I have consistently used across all my gaming history and online services. I have also created fanart for Hoyolab, which I posted on my Pixiv account, which uses the same username and is linked to my Hoyolab account. I recently found my old Hoyolab profile page, where my signature remains unchanged, I remember change to "cant post, they permanently muted me, thank you.". Although the username was altered. I participated in the Honkai Face Off Chibi Emote event, a cover of my pixiv and my reddit pfp is an art from that contest.</p>
        <p>Proof:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reddit post history: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/honkaiimpact3/s/K8KWvVvj83" target="_blank">Reddit</a></li>
            <li>Pixiv fanart linked to Hoyolab: 
                <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/107366359" target="_blank">Pixiv Artwork 1</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/108173644" target="_blank">Pixiv Artwork 2</a>
            </li>
            <li>Old Hoyolab profile: <a href="https://m.hoyolab.com/#/accountCenter/postList?id=7881365" target="_blank">Hoyolab Profile</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pictures I posted on Hoyolab are also on my Pixiv, proving the link between the accounts. I can provide the raw file, sketch etc if needed.</p>

        <h2>Gaming History</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Started playing Honkai Impact 3rd on August 28, 2019. First S-rank Valkyrie: Lightning Empress.</li>
            <li>Joined Genshin Impact on day one using a Realme C3 (RMX2020). First 5-star: Zhongli.</li>
            <li>Played Honkai Star Rail since launch. First rare character: Bai Lu.</li>
            <li>Received a Honkai snack physical gift from miHoYo, which could be matched with my previous IP login history.</li>
            <li>On January 6, 2023, my Honkai Impact 3rd login counter reached 1056 days. I have a screenshot of this on my phone as proof. However, the actual number of days from August 28, 2019, to January 6, 2023, is 1227 days. This suggests that there were days when I did not log in, so that suppose to be only me, mihoyo, and god who knows when I got my 1056th login strike .</li>
